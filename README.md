Guideline for Accessing and Running the Project
1. Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MySQL Server (for the backend database)
2. Project Structure
Your project contains the following two main parts:

Frontend (React app): Located in the secondapp.zip file.
Backend (Node.js app): Located in the user-backend folder.
3. Setting Up the Project
a. Frontend Setup
Extract the secondapp.zip file.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the extracted secondapp folder.
Run the following command to install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
b. Backend Setup
Navigate to the user-backend folder.
(Optional) If the backend has node_modules included, you donâ€™t need to install dependencies. If not, run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Update the database configuration in the backend code:
Locate the file where your MySQL database credentials are set (usually config.js or .env).
Update the credentials (e.g., username, password, database name) to match your local MySQL setup.
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
or
bash
Copy code
node server.js
The backend server should now be running, typically at http://localhost:5000.
c. Database Setup
Open your MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or terminal).
Create a database with the name used in your backend configuration (e.g., recipe_app).
Import the database schema or seed data, if provided (e.g., a .sql file).
sql
Copy code
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < schema.sql
4. Testing the Application
With both frontend and backend servers running, the React app will communicate with the backend API.
Test functionalities like viewing, adding, or editing recipes and managing user roles.
Recipe App Overview
Your recipe app is a robust application with the following key features:

User Roles
Admin:
Can add, edit, and delete recipes.
Can manage premium and regular users.
Users:
Can view categories, and add recipes to favorites.
Can comment on recipes and remove their own comments.
Core Functionalities
Recipe Management:
Add, edit, delete, and view recipes.
Categorized recipes for better navigation.
User Management:
Allows admins to manage users.
Premium users can manage favorites and comments.
Database Integration:
Recipes and user data are stored in a MySQL database.
Backend APIs handle communication between the frontend and database.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MySQL
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman (for testing APIs)
